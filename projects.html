        <h4>Short Summary</h4>
        <p>
          This M.Sc. dissertation comprehensively assesses antibiotic resistance
          (AMR), particularly carbapenem-resistant strains, in the Mahananda
          River. Utilizing both culture-based and eDNA metagenomic methods, the
          study identifies the prevalence of resistant bacteria and diverse
          antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), highlighting significant public
          health risks from environmental contamination.
        </p>

        <h4>Project Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To create a database on the abundance of culturable
            antibiotic-resistant bacteria with special emphasis on
            carbapenem-resistant strains.
          </li>
          <li>
            To isolate and screen carbapenem-resistant and metallo-β-lactamase
            (MBL) producing bacterial isolates.
          </li>
          <li>
            To explore the river's antibiotic resistome through whole-metagenome
            analysis of collected water samples.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
          The study utilized both culture-dependent and culture-independent
          methodologies.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Culture-Dependent Methods:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Sample Collection:</strong> Water samples were collected
            from a selected middle stream section of the Mahananda River over a
            three-month period at distinct morning and evening times to assess
            diurnal variation. Samples were transported in sterilized
            screw-capped bottles in an icebox to preserve microbial composition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Isolation of Carbapenem-Resistant Bacteria:</strong> Samples
            underwent 10-fold serial dilutions and were plated on Luria Bertani
            (LB) agar supplemented with Imipenem-Cilastatin (IC).
            Morphologically distinct colonies were selected for further
            analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Isolation of Benzylpenicillin-Resistant Bacteria:</strong>
            Samples were inoculated into an enrichment medium containing
            benzylpenicillin potassium salt as the sole carbon source to isolate
            distinct colonies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Screening for Metallo-β-Lactamase (MBL) Producers:</strong>
            MBL production was screened using the EDTA assay method. Out of 57
            initial isolates, 12 were confirmed as MBL producers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phenotypic Characterization:</strong> Selected isolates
            underwent biochemical tests (KOH string test, catalase, oxidase,
            indole, citrate utilization) following Bergey's Manual of Systematic
            Bacteriology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Antibiotic Susceptibility Profile:</strong> Susceptibility
            of MBL-producing strains to a panel of 25 antibiotics was determined
            using the disk diffusion method, following EUCAST guidelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) Index Determination:</strong
            >
            The MAR index was calculated for each isolate, with values >20%
            indicating high-risk contamination sources.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Culture-Independent Methods (Metagenomics):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Metagenome Extraction:</strong> DNA was extracted from mixed
            water samples using the QIAGEN DNeasy Power Water Kit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:</strong> Used to assess the
            quality of extracted metagenomic DNA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metagenome Sequencing:</strong> DNA that passed Quality
            Control (QC) was fragmented and sequenced using next-generation
            sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Metagenome Analysis:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Taxonomy Profiling:</strong> Performed using
                <code>MetaPhlAn4</code> to profile microbial community
                composition at the species level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Detection of ARGs and MGEs:</strong> Data was analyzed
                using the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase
                (<code>KBase</code>), involving trimming reads with
                <code>Trimmomatic</code>, assembling with
                <code>metaSPAdes</code>, and annotating with
                <code>RASTtk</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Findings & Outcome</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Bacteria:</strong> A
            significant presence was detected, with the APMG02(A) sample showing
            the highest incidence at <strong>1.63%</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MBL-Producing Strains:</strong> Out of 57 selected isolates,
            <strong>12 (21.05%)</strong> were confirmed as MBL-producing
            strains, predominantly Gram-negative bacteria, indicating a high
            prevalence of this resistance mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biochemical Characterization:</strong> Most MBL producers
            were Gram-negative (9/12), oxidase-positive (10/12), and
            catalase-positive (8/12), suggesting adaptation to aerobic river
            conditions and reflecting a complex microbial community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High Antibiotic Resistance:</strong> All 12 strains
            displayed uniform resistance to critical β-lactam antibiotics and
            imipenem. Some strains were alarmingly resistant to last-resort
            antibiotics like vancomycin and linezolid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) Index:</strong> All
            tested MBL-positive isolates showed MAR index values >20%,
            indicating high-risk contamination sources. Five strains exhibited
            very high multiple drug resistance (MAR Index ≥ 60%), with one
            reaching <strong>84%</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Categorization of Resistant Strains:</strong> Most isolates
            (10/12) were classified as extensively drug-resistant
            (<strong>XDR</strong>), with only two falling into the multi-drug
            resistant (<strong>MDR</strong>) group. No pan-drug resistant (PDR)
            strains were identified.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ARG & MGE Profile:</strong> Metagenomic analysis revealed a
            diverse range of ARGs (for aminoglycosides, macrolides, β-lactams,
            quinolones) and a high prevalence of mobile genetic elements like
            <strong>Integron integrase IntI1</strong> and conjugative transposon

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Helminthiasis, caused by various types of worms, is a widespread and
          hazardous human infection that can lead to internal organ damage,
          primarily spread through contaminated food. While synthetic drugs are
          available, they often come with various side effects. There is a
          growing need to develop efficient anti-helminthic agents from
          traditional medicine, particularly from plants, which are a valuable
          resource for tropical developing countries. Acacia nilotica has been
          historically recognized for its numerous therapeutic activities,
          including its efficacy against various pathogens and parasitic
          infections, with its root bark specifically used to cure such
          ailments. Based on its traditional use by villagers and tribal
          populations for common diseases, Acacia nilotica was selected for this
          experimental study. The project's comprehensive approach aims to
          contribute to the global effort to find new, effective drugs that can
          overcome the limitations of current synthetic treatments, particularly
          those without adverse side effects
        </p>

        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>
          To investigate the phytochemical and anthelmintic potential of
          different extracts of Acacia nilotica leaves and flowers when applied
          to the Indian adult earthworm (Pheretima posthuma), which serves as an
          anatomical model for human roundworm parasites.
        </p>

        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>The study employed the following methodologies:</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The study confirmed the traditional use of <em>Acacia nilotica</em> in
          treating helminthiasis, demonstrating its potential as a source of new
          anthelmintic agents. The methanolic extract showed superior activity
          compared to the aqueous extract, particularly at the 100 mg/ml
          concentration. The presence of various phytoconstituents suggests that
          these compounds may contribute to the observed anthelmintic effects.
          The study concluded that <em>Acacia nilotica</em> possesses promising
          phytoconstituents and significant anthelmintic activity against the
          Indian adult earthworm. The 100 mg/ml concentration of both methanolic
          and aqueous extracts yielded very satisfactory results for both
          paralysis and death times. This plant is considered to open a new
          avenue for drug researchers, offering potential for developing
          important drugs with fewer side effects.

        <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
        <p>
          The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens has
          triggered a renewed global interest in natural product discovery,
          especially antibiotics from soil microorganisms. This project aimed to
          isolate soil-dwelling bacteria capable of producing antimicrobial
          compounds effective against MDR pathogens such as MRSA, ESBL-producing
          E. coli, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using
          classical microbiological techniques, promising antibiotic-producing
          strains were screened and preliminarily characterized. Results
          demonstrated that soil remains a rich and largely untapped source of
          novel bioactive metabolites. The project also served as a practical
          and educational model for undergraduate research on antimicrobial
          resistance.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Antibiotics revolutionized modern medicine, but their widespread
          misuse has led to the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to
          multiple drugs. MDR pathogens now threaten the effectiveness of
          standard treatments for infections. At the same time, the discovery
          rate of new antibiotics has declined sharply. Historically, many
          antibiotics have originated from soil bacteria, particularly
          actinomycetes like Streptomyces. This project was designed to revisit
          soil bioprospecting with a focus on discovering antibiotic-producing
          isolates capable of inhibiting MDR bacteria.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To isolate soil bacteria from different natural environments.</li>
          <li>
            To screen isolates for antibacterial activity against known MDR
            pathogens.
          </li>
          <li>
            To characterize active isolates using basic morphological and
            biochemical techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            To evaluate soil as a potential source for discovering new
            antimicrobial agents.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Materials and Methods</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1 Soil Sample Collection:</strong> Soil was collected from
          various habitats including agricultural fields, forest floors, and
          organic compost piles. Samples were air-dried and stored at 4°C.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2 Microbial Isolation:</strong> Serial dilution followed by
          spread plating was used on Nutrient Agar (NA), Starch Casein Agar
          (SCA), and Actinomycete Isolation Agar (AIA). Plates were incubated at
          28–30°C for 5–7 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3 Morphological and Biochemical Characterization:</strong>
          Characterization included colony features, Gram staining, and
          catalase/oxidase tests. Growth patterns were noted to distinguish
          Streptomyces and Bacillus species.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.4 Antibacterial Screening:</strong> Primary screening was
          done via the Cross-Streak Method. Secondary screening used the Agar
          Well Diffusion Assay, where zones of inhibition from cell-free
          supernatants were measured in mm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.5 Test Pathogens:</strong> Standard lab or clinical isolates
          included Escherichia coli (ESBL-producing), Staphylococcus aureus
          (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (carbapenem-resistant), and Pseudomonas
          aeruginosa.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Results</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Total isolates obtained: 50</li>
          <li>Preliminary active isolates: 12</li>
          <li>Strong antimicrobial activity (zone ≥ 12 mm): 6 isolates</li>
          <li>
            Most active isolates were morphologically consistent with
            actinomycetes or Bacillus spp.
          </li>
          <li>
            A forest soil isolate showed broad-spectrum activity against all
            tested MDR strains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pigment-producing isolates often correlated with positive inhibition
            results, suggesting secondary metabolite involvement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>6. Discussion</h4>
        <p>
          Soil ecosystems, particularly in diverse and organic-rich
          environments, harbor a wealth of bioactive microbes. The ability of
          certain isolates to inhibit MDR pathogens suggests that they produce
          novel or underexplored antimicrobial compounds. The project also
          reinforced the usefulness of simple, low-cost screening techniques for
          identifying bioactive strains, making them ideal for undergraduate
          laboratories. Future work could involve molecular characterization
          (16S rRNA sequencing) and metabolite purification to identify the
          novel antibiotics produced.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          This mini-project successfully demonstrated that soil microbes,
          particularly those from undisturbed environments, exhibit significant
          antimicrobial activity against MDR bacteria. Several isolates showed
          promising activity that could warrant further purification and
          chemical characterization, contributing to the broader effort of
          rediscovering natural antibiotics.

        <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
        <p>
          Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to rise globally, with
          hospital wastewater serving as a critical environmental reservoir for
          resistant bacteria and mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. This
          project investigated the presence of plasmid-mediated antibiotic
          resistance in environmental Escherichia coli isolates from hospital
          effluents. A combination of microbiological and molecular techniques
          was used to isolate, characterize, and test the resistance profiles of
          E. coli, with particular focus on plasmid carriage. Results confirmed
          the prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains and the role of plasmids
          in facilitating resistance gene dissemination, highlighting the need
          for stricter effluent management from healthcare facilities.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Plasmids—extrachromosomal DNA molecules capable of horizontal gene
          transfer—play a key role in the spread of resistance genes among
          bacterial populations. Hospital wastewater contains not only
          pathogenic bacteria but also residual antibiotics, providing ideal
          conditions for resistance selection. In this context, E. coli serves
          as a model organism for tracking AMR in the environment due to its
          prevalence, ease of isolation, and role as a fecal indicator.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To isolate and identify E. coli strains from hospital wastewater.
          </li>
          <li>To determine their antibiotic susceptibility profiles.</li>
          <li>
            To extract and characterize plasmid DNA from resistant isolates.
          </li>
          <li>
            To establish whether the observed resistance is plasmid-mediated.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Materials and Methods</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1 Sample Collection & Isolation:</strong> Hospital
          wastewater was collected and processed within 2 hours. Samples were
          plated on Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar, and colonies with a
          characteristic metallic green sheen were selected. Confirmation was
          done using standard biochemical tests (IMViC, urease, catalase).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2 Susceptibility Testing:</strong> The Kirby-Bauer disk
          diffusion method was used to test isolates against Ampicillin,
          Tetracycline, Cefotaxime, Ciprofloxacin, and Gentamicin, with results
          interpreted per CLSI guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3 Plasmid Analysis:</strong> Plasmid DNA was extracted from
          resistant isolates using an alkaline lysis method. Electrophoresis was
          performed on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to visualize
          and estimate plasmid sizes.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Results</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A total of <strong>24 E. coli isolates</strong> were confirmed from
            the collected samples.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>75% (18 isolates)</strong> exhibited resistance to at least
            one tested antibiotic, with 10 isolates showing multidrug
            resistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plasmid DNA (ranging from 2–10 kb) was detected in 14 of the
            resistant isolates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Post-curing experiments confirmed that resistance to ampicillin and
            tetracycline was plasmid-mediated in selected isolates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>6. Discussion</h4>
        <p>
          The high prevalence of resistant E. coli in hospital wastewater
          confirms significant environmental exposure to antibiotic pressure.
          The identification of plasmid-borne resistance supports the critical
          role of horizontal gene transfer in MDR proliferation. These results
          have important implications for environmental AMR surveillance and
          suggest that wastewater from healthcare settings requires more
          stringent control measures before discharge.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          This study reveals a high prevalence of plasmid-mediated antibiotic
          resistance in E. coli from hospital wastewater. The findings emphasize
          the importance of monitoring environmental reservoirs of AMR. On an
          educational level, this project provided a comprehensive research
          experience, combining classical microbiology with modern molecular
          diagnostics in a real-world context.

        <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
        <p>
          The emergence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing
          bacteria has rendered many common antibiotics ineffective. This
          project explored the antimicrobial activity of aqueous and ethanol
          extracts from selected medicinal plants against ESBL-producing strains
          of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using standard
          microbiological techniques, we identified plant extracts with
          promising inhibitory effects, demonstrating that traditional medicinal
          plants may provide alternative strategies for combatting resistant
          bacterial infections.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          With antibiotic resistance accelerating globally, ESBL-producing
          bacteria represent a major clinical concern as they can hydrolyze a
          broad range of β-lactam antibiotics. As a result, attention is
          shifting back to nature for therapeutic alternatives. Medicinal
          plants, rich in phytochemicals like flavonoids and alkaloids, possess
          antimicrobial properties. This project aimed to screen selected plant
          extracts for activity against ESBL strains, highlighting their
          relevance in the global search for novel antimicrobial agents.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To prepare aqueous and ethanol extracts of selected medicinal plants
            (Neem, Tulsi, Turmeric).
          </li>
          <li>
            To test the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against
            ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
          </li>
          <li>To compare plant extract efficacy with standard antibiotics.</li>
          <li>
            To evaluate the potential of plant-derived compounds in overcoming
            ESBL-mediated resistance.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Materials and Methods</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>4.1 Plant Material & Extraction:</strong> Leaves and rhizomes
          of Azadirachta indica, Ocimum sanctum, and Curcuma longa were
          collected, dried, and powdered. Aqueous extracts were prepared by
          boiling in distilled water, while ethanolic extracts were prepared by
          soaking in 70% ethanol. Extracts were then filtered and concentrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.2 Bacterial Isolates:</strong> Confirmed ESBL-producing
          strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were obtained from a
          microbiology lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4.3 Antimicrobial Testing:</strong> The agar well diffusion
          method was used on Mueller-Hinton agar. 100 µL of each extract was
          added to 6 mm wells. Cefotaxime was used as a positive control and the
          solvents as negative controls. Plates were incubated and zones of
          inhibition were measured.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Results</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ethanolic extracts consistently demonstrated higher efficacy than
            aqueous extracts for all three plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Azadirachta indica (Neem)</strong> ethanolic extract showed
            the highest activity, with inhibition zones up to
            <strong>17 mm</strong> against E. coli and
            <strong>15 mm</strong> against Klebsiella.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi)</strong> also exhibited notable
            inhibition (approx. 13–14 mm), especially in its ethanolic form.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curcuma longa (Turmeric)</strong> showed only mild activity
            in its crude extract form.
          </li>
          <li>
            The results confirmed the presence of bioactive phytochemicals
            capable of inhibiting ESBL-producing bacterial strains.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>6. Discussion</h4>
        <p>
          This study supports the traditional use of medicinal plants as
          antimicrobial agents. The superior activity of ethanolic extracts is
          likely due to the better solubility of active phytochemicals. The
          substantial inhibition of ESBL-producing bacteria indicates that some
          plant-derived compounds may bypass beta-lactamase-mediated resistance,
          encouraging further studies on purification and mechanism of action.
        </p>

        <h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          The antimicrobial activity observed in neem and tulsi extracts offers
          promising leads for natural alternatives against drug-resistant
          pathogens. While not immediate replacements for antibiotics, they can
          complement existing therapies or serve as sources for novel drug
          development. This project emphasized the role of ethnomedicine in
          modern microbiological research.
